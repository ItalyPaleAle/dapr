# Dapr 1.10.8

## Fixed Dapr accepting components with impossible names in standalone mode

### Problem

When running in standalone mode, Dapr would parse and accept components which
had impossible names, making them unusable.

### Impact

Impacts users running Dapr <= 1.10.7 in standalone mode.

### Root cause

Dapr was not validating the component name when running in standalone mode.

### Solution

Added validation of the component name when running in standalone mode.
Components with impossible names will be rejected during startup.

## Fixed an issue with service invocation path decoding

### Problem

Encoded path segments in service invocation requests (e.g.
`http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/myapp/method/MyMethod%2F1`) were being
decoded by Dapr before being passed to the application. This meant the path
could be routed to the wrong app, or the app would receive a decoded path (
`MyMethod/1` in the example above) instead of the encoded path.

### Impact

Since v1.10.7, requests to service invocation endpoints with encoded path
segments may be routed to the wrong app, or the app will receive a decoded path
instead of the encoded path.

### Root cause

The Dapr HTTP server was decoding the path before passing it to the application.

### Solution

We changed the Dapr HTTP server to pass the path to the application without
decoding it.

## Fix panic in service invocation when connection to target sidecar fails

### Problem

When performing service invocation, a Dapr sidecar could have experienced a panic if the connection to the target sidecar failed to be established.

### Impact

This issue impacts users on Dapr 1.10.0-1.10.7.

### Root cause

The issue was due to improper error handling of failures to connect to a target sidcar.

### Solution

We improved the error handling routines to prevent panics in case of errors while establishing a connection to a target sidecar.
